# To-Do-List
Second Project!!! Lots of new Stuff dug out...but still need to understand it :)

Download all the Files on your desktop and then open up the html file.

NOTE: DOESN'T WORK THAT PROPERLY FOR SMARTPHONES!!

FEATURE: Now you can delete as well as cross your completed tasks!!
         Also, your browser will automatically store your to - do list data and you can edit it even after closing or reloading the HTML f          file!!
